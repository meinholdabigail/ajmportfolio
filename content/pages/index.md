    subtitle: >-
      I am a student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania studying
      communications media marketing and earning a minor in psychology. In the
      past year I have honed my passions and gained hands-on experience; by
      working on a music themed television show, I have effectively combined my
      love for music with my studies. I aim to help small, local musicians
      expand their reach and grow their audiences.
